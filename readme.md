# Orban Optimod SNMP to EmberPlus Gateway

This project is a Node.jsâ€“based gateway that polls an Orban Optimod (this is built for 8700i) device via SNMP and publishes its status and monitoring data to EmberPlus clients. The EmberPlus tree includes:

- **Device Info**: Firmware version and station name.
- **Monitoring**: Input statuses (analog, digital, silent, error, power supply).
- **Status**: A flag indicating if the device is connected and a timestamp for the last successful SNMP poll.

## Features

- **SNMP Polling**: Regularly polls the Optimod using SNMP to retrieve key device parameters.
- **EmberPlus Tree**: Uses the `emberplus-connection` library to build and update an EmberPlus tree.
- **Status Indicators**: Provides immediate feedback on connection status and data freshness.
- **Docker Support**: Easily containerize the application using the provided Dockerfile and docker-compose configuration.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or later)
- npm
